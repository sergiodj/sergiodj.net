Well, here we go again.

After some years inactive on [http://sergiosdj.wordpress.com/][1], I
decided to give it another try with this brand new blog.  I'm now
using [Octopress][2], which is an awesome static blog generator (it is
actually a framework on top of [Jekyll][3]), and I also plan to post
something about how to setup your own blog with it.

My plans are to write stuff about internals of [GDB][4], and anything
else related to GNU/Linux.  I hope you like it.
