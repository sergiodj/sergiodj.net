Well, this blog is still not 100% the way I want.  The reason is simple:
because it is a static generated blog (built on top of a framework), I
need to spend a little more time configuring it.

Right now, you may miss a few features:

### Comments

Privacy is something that I really respect, and not only for me.  I do not
want to use some service here that will hurt your (reader) privacy, so that
is why I still don't have a comment system here.  Octopress, which is the
framework I use to generate this blog, has a built-in support for
[Disqus][1], which is a comment system.  The service is nice, but there is
one drawback: it uses user information and sells them to third-party
companies.  It is possible to comment as anonymous, though.  So for now, I
haven't decided if I will use it, or implement something else.

If you know of a comment system that respects user privacy (I know, it may
be utopical), please contact me on IRC (Freenode server, nickname is the
same as my domain).  Thank you!

### Archive

Octopress (and Jekyll) has a poor system for archiving posts.  I had to do
some hacks on the platform, but it is still useless (as you can see by the
*Archives* section at the right side).  I promise I will fix it, but since I
have other things to do, it might take some time.

Anyway, I expect to have those issues fixed ASAP.  Meanwhile, I hope you are
enjoying the blog overall.
